auto map to the car the virtual part i created
i deleted a virtual part and i recreated it and it didnt show up
how do i see if an item matched with the oem number i proposed and it transition to real part
parts mapping management should refresh when i add a virtual part because i cant find them in the same session i need to search
also give me a filter to show only virtual
go through the ui changes when you inish
