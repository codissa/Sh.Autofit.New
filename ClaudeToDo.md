1.  in plate lookup i want all the data you can show about the car, transmission, engine code, fuel type every thing you can show show
2. in car management and in mapping and in suggestions i want you to seperate transmissions and trimlevel to different groups, if model name has different transmissions and trim levels show them as different groupd, (also in other places where you group model names make sure you differentiate it and show the differences search also in teh dialogs make sure to change in every place relevant )
3. in mapping tab show next to model name fuel type trim level and transmission
4. in car management show also in each vehicle in the list  fuel type trim level and transmission and engine volume
5. in the data sarvice make sure the unmap parts has similar logic to map parts
6. in map and unmap parts where you group similar model names and engine volume and map tp them make sure you also compare trim level and transmission before mapping to the whole group
